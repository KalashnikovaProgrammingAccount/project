### ðŸš€ **Creating presentations â€” brilliant simplicity**

**ðŸŽ¤ How to create a presentation that won't let you sleep?**

Slides are not just text and pictures, they are a story that captivates. We share life hacks so that your presentation will be remembered!

### **ðŸ“Œ 5 steps to the perfect presentation**
1. **Goal first**
â€” Why are you doing it? (Inspire, inform, sell?)
â€” Who is your audience? (Colleagues, clients, investors?)

2. **Structure is the key**
â€” Introduction (hook from the first seconds: question, fact, story).
â€” Main part (3-5 key ideas, no fluff).
â€” A bright ending (call to action or a memorable quote).

3. **Design without chaos**
â€” 1 slide = 1 thought.
â€” Minimum text, maximum visuals (photos, diagrams, icons).
â€” Contrasting colors and legible font (no Comic Sans!).

4. **Practice instead of perfectionism**
â€” Rehearse out loud, check timing.
â€” Prepare for questions (and technical glitches, too).

5. **Tricks for engagement**
â€” Interactive: polls, short videos, lively dialogue.
â€” A story from personal experience ("Once we encountered...").

### **ðŸ’¡ What to avoid?**
â€” Overloaded slides.
â€” Monotonous delivery.
â€” Template phrases ("As Steve Jobs said...").

**Your presentation is your world. Make it interesting!** ðŸš€
