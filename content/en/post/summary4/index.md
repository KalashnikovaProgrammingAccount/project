## Week in Review:

**ðŸ’– My Week: Between Deadlines and Desserts**

Hello, my dears! ðŸ‘‹ Without further ado, here's how these seven days went in "I can do it all" mode (spoiler: I didn't).

### **âœ¨ Key Moments**

- **Monday:** Started the week with grandiose plans. By evening, I realized that my maximalism ended with the third item on the list.

- **Wednesday:** Accidentally put on makeup for only one eye before a Zoom meeting. My colleagues pretended not to notice - heroes.

- **Friday:** The long-awaited weekend! *[Reality: Saturday was spent getting enough sleep, Sunday - panicking before Monday]*.

### **ðŸ˜³ Awkward but cute**
I forgot the name of the movie that was "well, that one, with that actor...". I spent half an hour explaining it to my friend using gestures - in the end it turned out to be "Pretty Woman".

### **ðŸ’¡ Discovery of the week**
If you listen to podcasts at 2x speed, the day becomes more productive... but by the evening your brain feels like whipped cream.

### **ðŸŒ¸ Plans for the new week**
- Try to get up "earlier" (but don't specify how much).
- Finally sort out the closet (or at least look at it with a determined look).
- Find a balance between "I want everything" and "I can do nothing".

**How â€‹â€‹was your week?** Let's share in the comments - it's more fun together! ðŸ’¬âœ¨

P.S. If you also spent a week looking for a lipstick that is always in your bag, but disappears at the most needed moment - you and I are of the same blood. ðŸ’„ðŸ˜‚
