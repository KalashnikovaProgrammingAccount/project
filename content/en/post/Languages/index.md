Welcome 👋

**🚀Scientific programming languages: what will the future be written in?**

Hello, geeks and researchers! 👩💻👨💻 If you work with data, model processes, or analyze experiments, this is the place for you. Let's look at the main languages ​​that turn hypotheses into discoveries.

### **🔬 TOP 5 languages ​​for science**
1. **Python** 🐍
- *Why?* Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- *For what?* Data analysis, ML, visualization.
- *Hint:* Simplicity + power = perfect for a start.

2. **R** 📊
- *Why?* Created for statistics (ggplot2, dplyr).
- *For what?* Bioinformatics, economics, sociology.
- *Feature:* The best graphics "out of the box".

3. **Julia** ⚡
- *Why?* The speed of C++ with the convenience of Python.
- *What for?* Numerical calculations, physical modeling.
- *Feature:* The magic of **JIT compilation** (and a cute logo).

4. **MATLAB** 🔧
- *Why?* Ready-made toolboxes for engineers.
- *What for?* Signals, system control, neural networks.
- *Feature:* Everything works "with one button" (but for a fee).

5. **Fortran/C++** 🦖
- *Why?* Supercomputers love them for their speed.
- *What for?* Astrophysics, quantum calculations, CFD.
- *Feature:* Immortal HPC classics.

### **💡 How to choose?**
- **Newbie?** Python → Julia.
- **Statistics?** R → Python.
- **Supercomputer?** Fortran → C++.

### **🚨 Myths**
- "Python is slow" → **Numba/Cython** speed up code by 100 times.
- "MATLAB is dying" → Lives in engineering and universities.

P.S. If your code ever worked after the magical `sudo rm -rf` — you are a hero. 😅
